# Encoding project : Alfred de Musset's plays

This project aims to highlight Alfred de Musset's dramaturgical work. This work could form part of the creation of a digital library dedicated to the work of this French poet, playwright and novelist. 
The 19th century saw the emergence of the Romantic dramatic form, which had the distinctive feature of preserving the traditional structure of classical theatre, while offering its representatives a great deal of creative freedom by mixing genres, including the tragic, the comic and the burlesque.
Alfred de Musset's work is a regular subject of study in French literature, therefore this project is partly aimed at a university audience.

The materials include selected excerpts from the final scenes of *La Nuit v√©nitienne* (1830), *Les Caprices de Marianne* (1833), and *On ne badine pas avec l'amour* (1834), three plays in prose, in which the characters often appear tormented and have an unfortunate ending. These specific scenes are key for understanding Musset's dramatic style, his treatment of characters, and the evolution of themes across his works.

XML encoding, specifically XML-TEI, is essential for this project because it enables a structured and standardized representation of the dramatic elements within each scene. By encoding the roles, speeches, and stage directions, XML can bring out the relationships between characters and the progression of dialogue. This structure will facilitate targeted analysis of the text, such as identifying speech patterns and character interactions, as well as assist in creating visualizations of these dynamics. Finally, encoding these plays in XML-TEI may eventually guarantee their interoperability, as well as a certain durability of these documents, in order to preserve Alfred de Musset's work.
